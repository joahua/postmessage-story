			ONE IFRAME'S STORY













Once upon a time, there was a page called Frame.













Frame grew up in its Parent's house, living in the same domain.












Frame had a friendly relationship with its Parent, and could talk to it about anything, whenever it wanted.

It also shared its Parent's things - including sampling the cookie jar occasionally. Not that there's anything wrong with that once in a while.












In time, Frame grew up. It got its own place – a domain of its own – and moved out of its Parent's place.












Like any good Parent, Frame's wanted it to stay in touch. And Frame, being a good child, tried.

But Frame couldn't reach it's Parent. It tried to go and visit, but the locks had been changed, and the family dog, Security, was barking at it!

	"SecurityError!", it yelped.

	"Blocked a frame with origin 'child' from accessing a frame with origin 'parent'", it woofed, as its overly-enthusiastic tail-wag sent Frame on its way.

Frame was confused – "Don't you know who I am?"














Frame decided to take a walk around the block, and started to wonder if sending its Parent pictures of cats had been a bad idea…













Frame had an idea.

The dog, Security, might not want to let Frame in, but it couldn't stop Frame from leaving a message.

Frame taped a sign to the front door:
	
	"Hi Parent! Security is being a real bitch and won't let me in. Anyway, happy birthday!" – it was Parent's birthday – "Enjoy the iTunes gift card!"

And attached the gift card to the message.

What could possibly go wrong?

Frame was just sitting around, downloading some resources, and then realised what it had done.

"Curse your sudden but inevitable paint job!" Frame <blink>ed, exasperatedly, realising that Parent's neighbours house had an indistinguishable façade.

It was the wrong house. The iTunes voucher was gone. Damn music junkie neighbours.

Birthday dreams, crushed.














Frame would have to postpone chasing the neighbours, because things were about to take a turn for the worse. Frame's evil twin, Evil Twin, showed up.

Evil Twin looked just like Frame, but the two could not be more different. Like Frame, Evil Twin had moved out – stealing all the cookies and their Parent's address book.

"Evil Twin!", Frame exclaimed. "What are you doing here?"

"Oh Frame, you're so naïve. I've been stealing cookies from Parent again!"

Frame looked shocked. "But Parent would never let you in! And how did you get past Security?"

[2]














"I just walked right in", ET confessed. "Parent really has become rather blind with age."

Evil Twin paused to wipe the crumbs away.

"Those cookies were delicious."
















Frame had to let its Parent know.

This time, it left the note in an envelope:

	To: Parent
	Address: http://parent/

	Message: "Evil Twin has returned."

The address was right, this time…

[3]















Parent, armed with this information, was alert at the door. It could hear movement outside.
















Before opening the door, it asked a question only Frame would know. Evil Twin, shocked, scurried off into the bushes. Security was curled up in its kennel the whole time, but Parent was on top of it.

[4]
















Parent let Frame know it had foiled the attack.

Sibling rivalry at its finest.
















Frame had so much to tell Parent, it said a whole array of things!

But when it tried to give Parent a gift (a JSON object, how thoughtful!), it wouldn't fit through the post. Parent's postbox was old; nearly as old as IE9.

To make it fit, Frame turned it into a long string with a trick it learnt in wizard school. "JSON.stringify!" Frame said to the object.

Luckily, its Parent was a JSON.parse-l tongue, so knew how to restore the string to the object it once was.
















A few months later, Parent moved out of pleasantville with its rows of identically painted houses into a Secure compound. Frame was relieved. Parent could do with some protection from Evil Twin, even if its savvy door checking had saved an entire box of Tim Tams a few months back.

The new house – a Chrome-plated palace with views over the Opera-house, Firefoxes frolicking in its extensive grounds – had a spacious mailbox that would happily accept objects of any size, so Frame sent Parent a package of deliciousness from its own cookie jar.
