Of course, in the story the Parent would need to follow Evil Twin's instructions for there to be any actual risk of cookie theft. We haven't introduced a vulnerability per se, but if we were evaluating the Twin's message there'd be a problem.




We also skipped over the part where Frame is impersonated by Evil Twin. This is a bit of a plot hole, because Parent is only checking to see that it came from a known child domain, which isn't secured so Evil Twin could just intercept and inject arbitrary data.




Assuming that ET could only redirect the child to their own domain, but not insert any content, this would work. Not very plausible, though.



The moral of the story is 'use SSL everywhere' and 'check your inputs'.
